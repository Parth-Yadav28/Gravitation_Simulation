Gravitational Simulation with Collisions and Explosions
A real-time gravity simulation built with Pygame, featuring Verlet integration and other stuff.

Features:
Gravity Simulation – Objects attract each other using Newtonian gravity.
Custom Density Scaling – Density determines mass, allowing planets from Pluto-sized to Sun-sized.
Mouse-Based Object Creation – Click and drag to create custom planets with velocity.
How to Use:
Left-Click: Create a planet (drag to adjust velocity).
Backspace: Clear all objects.
Esc: Quit simulation.
Future Enhancements:
gonna think about it
